Nokia Qt LGPL Exception version 1.1

As an additional permission to the GNU Lesser General Public License
version 2.1, the object code form of a "work that uses the Library"
may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the
Library.  You may distribute such object code under terms of your
choice, provided that:
(i) the header files of the Library have not been modified; and
(ii) the incorporated material is limited to numerical parameters,
data structure layouts, accessors, macros, inline functions and
templates; and
(iii) you comply with the terms of Section 6 of the GNU
Lesser General Public License version 2.1.

Moreover, you may apply this exception to a modified version of the
Library, provided that such modification does not involve copying
material from the Library into the modified Library?s header files
unless such material is limited to (i) numerical parameters; (ii) data
structure layouts; (iii) accessors; and (iv) small macros, templates
and inline functions of five lines or less in length.

Furthermore, you are not required to apply this additional permission
to a modified version of the Library.
